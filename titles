Functional Programming is a programming paradigm that can help you reduce code complexity while improving application reliability; but...how? In this talk, I'll take you on a guided tour down the path I took from learning JavaScript to incorporating functional techniques into my daily practice. Along the way, you'll learn what Functional Programming is, why it's useful, and how you can start using it today!

Functional Programming: A Guided Tour

I would like to be introduced something like, "Forrest Akin is a Back-end Engineer @ NuORDER, a B2B Wholesale eCommerce provider, where he practices FP in JS every day (after his morning drumming). He is a self-proclaimed rhythm-junky, chess-dabbler, Michelle-lover, and pizza-worshipper."
